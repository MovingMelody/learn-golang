SOLID Principles - Set of 5 design principles for creating maintainable and scalable software. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells. Introduced by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. Every Class should have only one responsibility.

## Open Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Object of a superclass shall be replaceble with objects of its subclasses
without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle


## Dependency Inversion Principle
